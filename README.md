Template generator

I have 2 categories of messages: fixed messages or messages that need input.

Fixed messages are placed in 2 dropdown-type handles and dynamic ones have input boxes, dropdowns, and validations they depend on.

The "Copy content" and "Undo" buttons are used to manipulate the entire generated message. 

The "Copy content" function reloads the page after each click.
