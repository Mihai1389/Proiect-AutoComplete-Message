The application has the role of creating custom messages with dynamic character.
All templates that contain input have a validator, so the message cannot be generated if all characters are not filled in (ex: Card - declaration).

In order to run the application you need to download it locally, unzip it (very important) and then open the index.html file.

The interface contains 5 sections.

First section:
The first 2 dropboxes are for fixed messages. On the left having messages

2nd section:
Contains 3 categories:
1.Card - Where templates are exclusively meant for cards.
2.E-wllat: we have a dropbox item where you choose 1 of the 3 available options, and 2 inboxes where they can fill in data.
3.Debit Calculator: it is a section where I use a calculator that stafisfy my need to deduct the amount after fees. The Deposit section is for a dynamic message.

A-3rd section
The "Custom message" section is intended for manually written messages, when the "submit" button is pressed the message is sent to the "output" container where it can be connected with other templates.

 4th section:
The "Copy content" button copies all messages from the final out-put and gives page refrash and the "undo" button affects the last general message.

And in the 5th section we have an output where each message is inserted, with a <br> between each generated message.
